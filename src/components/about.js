                I’m a software engineer who enjoys building reliable, user-focused applications and working across the stack to turn ideas into shipped features. I’m especially interested in problems that sit at the intersection of frontend experience, backend logic, and system design.

                Recently, I’ve been working on TutorsTap, a mentorship platform that connects learners with industry professionals. My work spans frontend development, backend APIs, cloud infrastructure, and automated testing, with a strong focus on building features that are maintainable, scalable, and grounded in real user needs.

                I also contribute to open-source projects such as WeVote and FreeCodeCamp, where I collaborate with distributed teams to improve UI behavior, accessibility, and application reliability. I value clear communication, thoughtful code reviews, and learning from real-world production systems.

                Outside of engineering, I’ve held leadership and coordination roles that involved supporting teams, organizing work, and creating environments where people can do their best work. I bring that same sense of ownership and accountability into my engineering work.

            <p className="opacity-50 mb-4">
                I’m always looking to grow as an engineer and take on meaningful challenges, whether that’s improving an existing system, contributing to open source, or building new products from the ground up.
